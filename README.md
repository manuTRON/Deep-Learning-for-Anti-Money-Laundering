# Deep-Learning-for-Anti-Money-Laundering
A traditional approach to detecting money laundering might rely on the amount of transaction that ensues, while a deep learning nonlinear technique would include time, geographic location, IP address, type of retailer, and any other feature that is likely to point to fraudulent activity. Money laundering (ML) is a serious crime which makes it necessary to develop detection methods in transactions. Some researches have been carried on, but the problem is not thoroughly solved. With neural networks, we aim to combat the serious crime of money laundering with the help of the layered approach of neural networks. The first layer of the neural network processes a raw data input like the amount of the transaction and passes it on to the next layer as output. The second layer processes the previous layer’s information by including additional information like the user's IP address and passes on its result. The next layer takes the second layer’s information and includes raw data like geographic location and makes the machine’s pattern even better. This continues across all levels of the neuron network. We aim to use these benefits of neural network and implement a Deep Recurrent Neural Network. We will also perform a comparative analysis with the main neural networks ANN and RNN to find which models perform better.
